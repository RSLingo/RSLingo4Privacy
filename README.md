# RSLingo4Privacy

The regular use of social networking websites and applications encompasses the collection and retention of personal and very often sensitive information about users. This information needs to remain private and each social network owns a privacy policy that describes in-depth how users' information is managed and disclosed. Problems arise when the development of new systems and applications includes an integration with social networks. The lack of clear understanding and a precise mechanism to enforce the statements described in privacy policies can compromise the development and adaptation of these statements. 

The main goal of this project is to improve privacy by providing companies a set of languages and tools to align their policies with their practices, namely by introducing a privacy requirements specification into the regular software development process that allow to align multi-party expectations across multi-tier applications. To that end, and in the context of recent results from the RSLingo approach and our privacy policy analysis, we intend to research techniques that allow users to specify privacy-specific linguistics patterns to allow automatic extraction of the relevant information from privacy policies into an equivalent intermediate (RSL-IL) format, and map or transform these specifications into equivalent Eddy specifications that, with proper tools allow checking conflicts between these privacy policies and user preferences and the developers’ privacy specifications. Moreover, the relevance of this research will be demonstrated through the analysis of real world privacy policies, namely those posted by the most popular web sites, such as Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Dropbox, IMDB or Zynga.
